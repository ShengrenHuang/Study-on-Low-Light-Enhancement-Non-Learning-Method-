# Study-on-Low-Light-Enhancement-Non-Learning-Method-

This repository is to implement low-light image enhancement by adopting a model-based dehazing algorithm. By referring to [1], we first invert the low-light image. Since the dark area in the image is similar to the haze area, we then use a dehazing algorithm to enhance the image. With the help of the dark channel prior [2][3], we enhance the dark area in the inverted image. Next, invert the image again to get the image with normal exposure. Notably, the model employed in the dehazing algorithm is presented in the following:      
Atmospheric Scattering Model  
$I(x) = J(x)t(x)+A(1-t(x))$  
where $I(x)$ is haze image, $J(x)$ is haze-free image, and $A(x)$ is global atmosphere lightã€‚Our goal is to estimate $J(x)$. The result shows that the method is valid.
